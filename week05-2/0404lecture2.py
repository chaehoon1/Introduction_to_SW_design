If you are, then you've prawn, er, won big, at least if you've paid a visit to the social feeds helmed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium staff. It is Shrimp Week, a playful period when the Cannery Row landmark pauses to "shellebrate" the small critter and its amazing attributes. No gifts, telegrams, or greeting cards are expected; after all, a card would get wet if you handed it to a shrimp and any presents might go unused. Rather, this shellebration is all about education and amusement, with the amusing elements hailing from the witty wordplay woven through the shrimp-themed posts. It's all happening on the aquarium's social pages, with so much afoot that it is difficult to keep (cara)pace.FAIRY SHRIMP TO GIANT PRAWN: Of course, the shrimp, though famously diminutive, isn't a one-size-fits-all kind of icon; the antennae-rocking, carapace-cool creatures boast a dazzling array of attributes.

Shrimply text 54159 -- oh, SHRIMPLYFB is what you'll want to specifically text -- then sit back and let the educational and ocean-y awesomeness wash over you or your phone, rather. But wait: Would you prefer to watch a cleaner shrimp cleaning? Cool: Here's two exciting hours of that thrilling krill-a-tude.'''.split()
